% @brief compute_SNR computes Signal-to-Noise Ration (SNR) of the
% ppg signal given the true pulse rate (only pulse rate components 
% assumed to be the signal of interest). See [1] for details
%
% INPUT
%   - spectrum - cell array 1 x nM of signal spectrums computed by 
%     nM various methods of ppg extraction or spectrum estimation
%     each cell contains a matrix nF x nT representing the spectrum with nF 
%     frequences and nT temporal points     
%   - freq - 1 x nF array of frequences represented in spectrums
%   - trueHR - 1 x nT array of true pulse rate values
%   - nBins - number of bins around the bin corresponding the true pulse
%     rate value, that are counted as signal and not as noise
%
% OUTPUT:
%   - matrix nT x nM, characterizing dynamics of SNR for each of the
%     methods
